# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## What is the Password Generator

The Password Generator is an application that can create an infinite amount of password possibilites with the interactive criteria system. After checking off on desired critierias, the Password Generator will generate a randomized password that can be copy and pasted into any login/signup destination.

## Why it was coded

This application was coded the way it has because the accessibility of creating stronger passwords without having to make the effort of creating lngthy passwords is vital. In addition, a prime example of getting accounts and information hacked or stolen is the lack of strength in passwords. With this application, creating strong passwords while putting in minimal effort will allow users to confidently create accounts without having to worry about their information getting stolen.

## How does the Password Generator work?

For the Password Generator to work, one must click on the red 'Generate Password'. Once clicked, you will be asked to input a numeric length for the desired password, within the range. You will  then be prompted with 4 critierias of lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters. IF clicked 'okay' it will accept the criteria and prompt the next one. If clicked 'cancel' it will disregard that criteria and move on to the next one. Once the four criterias have been chosen, the passwork will be generated and allowed to be copy and pasted into any signup or reset password scenario.
